#summary Web page screen capture using watch folder feature

ShareX does not have a web capture feature because it will involve rendering pages in background using Internet Explorer. You could, however, use extensions/addons developed for Chrome/Firefox browsers to capture the entire webpage and utilise the Watch Folder feature in ShareX to automatically upload them to your designated image hosting service. 

Here is an example using Chrome with the official Google screen capture extension. It will work exactly same for Firefox etc. with different addons.

1. Download Google Screen capture Chrome addon from here:

2. (Optional) Change image save location from here:

3. Open ShareX settings window, switch to Watch folder tab, add an existing folder to watch:
